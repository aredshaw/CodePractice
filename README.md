# CodePractice
I have written this code on my own. While I feel most comfortable with Java and Python, I have some familiarity with JavaScript as well. 

Each small program can be found in the directory labeled by programming language. 

For a much longer Java program I wrote, see [DebtPayoff](https://github.com/aredshaw/DebtPayoff).
