# CodePractice
I have written these code samples on my own while learning each respective language. While I have spent the most time with Java and Python, I have some experience writing JavaScript as well. 

Each small program can be found in the directory labeled according to programming language. 

If you want to see a much longer, and more useful Java program I wrote, see [DebtPayoff](https://github.com/aredshaw/DebtPayoff).
