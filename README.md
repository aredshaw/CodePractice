# CodePractice
[Java](https://github.com/aredshaw/CodePractice/tree/master/JavaCode) | [Python](https://github.com/aredshaw/CodePractice/tree/master/PythonCode) | [JavaScript](https://github.com/aredshaw/CodePractice/tree/master/JavaScriptCode)

For a while now, I have been trying to improve my coding skills. To accomplish this, each time I learned a new programming concept, I wrote a small program to demonstrate that concept. As any programmer will tell you, hands-on practice makes all the difference for programming mastery. So far, I am the most comfortable with Java, followed by Python, but I have delved some into writing JavaScript as well.

Each small program can be found in the directory labeled with that programming language.

If you want to see a much longer, and more useful Java program I wrote, see [DebtPayoff](https://github.com/aredshaw/DebtPayoff).
